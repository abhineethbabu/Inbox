Aircraft Performance Prediction using Machine Learning:


Military news analysis with Natural Language Processing (NLP):- Analyze military news articles or social media data to identify trends, track troop movements, or detect potential threats. (NLTK and spaCy)

Real-time guidance system using computer vision: Design a system using computer vision to track and adjust the trajectory of a missile in real-time based on visual cues from the target or surrounding environment. 

Predictive maintenance for missile components: Develop a model to predict when critical components in a missile need maintenance based on sensor data or historical maintenance records. 

Visualization of missile flight data: Develop a tool to visualize and analyze missile flight data (e.g., acceleration, altitude, direction), providing insights into its trajectory and performance.

Anomaly detection in INS logs: Analyze real or simulated INS log data to identify anomalies that might indicate sensor malfunction, equipment failure, or potential threats
